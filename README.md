## What it contains?
Contains snippets for Perl 6 that can be loaded with yasnippet in emacs.

## How to use?

Currently there is no native support to Perl 6 in emacs.

So `.p6` file will be opened in fundamental mode in emacs.
To use these snippets add this `fundamental-mode` folder inside `.emacs.d/snippets` directory.

Then open your `.p6` file. You are ready to go:

Typing `cls` then `TAB` will give you whole class, attributes and methods skeleton.


# Also
---

It also contains `perl6.json` file that contains snippets for Perl 6 for use in [Atom](https://atom.io/)
or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

There are many snippets. Explore and use !! ;)
